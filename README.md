# SeleniumProject2-TestNG
Its a Automation Project using the selenium Framework TestNG.
Using this Framework i am testing the Amazon application.
I have written the code in java language.
Here it performs login by sending the required data to the 
respective text boxes and after login it performs searching 
for the items and adding it to the cart.It performs all mouse
events, clicking checkbox,radio buttons ,switching between the
windows,switching between the Frames etc....
And finally it performs signOut activity.

In TestNG we are using annotation.
annotations made the programmer work easy. 
TestNG have many features like emailable-report.html and 
index.html etc..
